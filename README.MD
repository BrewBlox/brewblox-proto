# Shared interface types for Brewblox

Types for protobuf and typescript are maintained separately,
as one cannot be auto-generated from the other.

The repository is split in three parts:

`/proto` contains protobuf message definition.

`/ts` contains TypeScript enum and type definitions.

`/docs` contains JSON/YAML data to build documentation.

## Get started

Install protobuf compiler:

sudo snap install --classic protobuf
